We finally have multiple input audio!

When I was wondering about another problem regarding webcam usage in
live streams, I stumbled upon a forum post explaining how to use multiple
audio inputs with avconv. The solution was so simple, that I'm not sure
how I failed doing that.

I am not sure how well this thing works and if only one channel is
necessary for your stream, I suggest using only one channel, because
using multiple channels is not tested and the sound might get out of sync
but to what extend I have tested it, it seems to be working just fine.
