Previous multi-input audio update reverted

It seems I went ahead with the update too fast. According to my testing
the multi-input audio IS NOT YET working. When I tested it I messed with
the audio settings so that it simply picked up my voice from the stream
and made me think it worked fine, even though it really didn't.

I am sorry for causing any confusion and I hope to get this fixed eventually.
Until then you should use either this version, which has all additional
audio settings reverted back or the older 0.12.8 version.

We finally have multiple input audio!

When I was wondering about another problem regarding webcam usage in
live streams, I stumbled upon a forum post explaining how to use multiple
audio inputs with avconv. The solution was so simple, that I'm not sure
how I failed doing that.

I am not sure how well this thing works and if only one channel is
necessary for your stream, I suggest using only one channel, because
using multiple channels is not tested and the sound might get out of sync
but to what extend I have tested it, it seems to be working just fine.
