Release notes for 0.14.5

As this new release has more new features than previous ones, I decided
to write more formal release notes for this one. Instead of focusing on
stability, like in the previous versions, I went all in on new tech that
I found out about (mainly piping FFmpeg output to another FFmpeg process)
and added something rather exciting. Here are the release notes:

- Added support for primitive watermarking through piping-technique
- Settings window has options for enabling/disabling watermarking and
  choosing the PNG file that will be used for watermarks
- The quality option is now renamed Compression and the choices are done
  through a drop-down menu instead of a text entry.
- Subprocessing has been updated to handle double encoding

I think watermarking is a huge step forwards, though the current
implementation is rather limited and it can cause lower framerates and
framedrops when you are streaming something more dynamic (eg. a game) but
if you have a more powerful computer or you want to stream something more
static, such as slower 2D games or text, then it should still work.

Hopefully you will enjoy this release!

More Streaming Service Variety!

As of now Castawesome natively supports (that is without hacks) three
livestreaming services: Twitch.tv, Hitbox.tv and YouTube. I came up with
this idea when Twitch pretty much broke their servers and I had to use
YouTube's RTMP servers for a while. To use them, however, you had to
crack open your text editor and edit the avconv/ffmpeg parameters manually,
which is not user-friendly. You might remember that I originally wrote
Castawesome to escape the CLI avconv/ffmpeg scripts and that's what I
intend to do now.

As a side-note: happy new year! May it bring more livestreams and other
goodness to Linux users all over the world!

Previous multi-input audio update reverted

It seems I went ahead with the update too fast. According to my testing
the multi-input audio IS NOT YET working. When I tested it I messed with
the audio settings so that it simply picked up my voice from the stream
and made me think it worked fine, even though it really didn't.

I am sorry for causing any confusion and I hope to get this fixed eventually.
Until then you should use either this version, which has all additional
audio settings reverted back or the older 0.12.8 version.

We finally have multiple input audio!

When I was wondering about another problem regarding webcam usage in
live streams, I stumbled upon a forum post explaining how to use multiple
audio inputs with avconv. The solution was so simple, that I'm not sure
how I failed doing that.

I am not sure how well this thing works and if only one channel is
necessary for your stream, I suggest using only one channel, because
using multiple channels is not tested and the sound might get out of sync
but to what extend I have tested it, it seems to be working just fine.
